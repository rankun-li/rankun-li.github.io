I am a second-year graduate student in Control Science and Engineering at the [School of Future Technology](https://ai.shu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai University](https://www.shu.edu.cn/). My supervisor is Professor [Linqi Ye](https://linqi-ye.github.io/). I completed my Bachelor's degree in Electronic and Information Engineering at the [School of Communication and Information Engineering](https://scie.shu.edu.cn/), Shanghai University. 

I am a beginner in reinforcement learning for legged/humanoid robots.
